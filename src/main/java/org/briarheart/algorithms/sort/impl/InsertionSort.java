/**
 * Current implementation makes ~ 1/2 n^2 compares and exchanges in the worst case, so it is not suitable for
 * sorting large arbitrary arrays. More precisely, the number of exchanges is exactly equal to the number of
 * inversions. So, for example, it sorts a partially-sorted array in linear time.
 *
 * <p> The sorting algorithm is stable and uses O(1) extra memory.
 *
 * <p> This algorithm has O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity in the average case.
